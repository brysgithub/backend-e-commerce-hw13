## Description

This application is used to create a database that can organize products by category as well as keep track of current price and stock. 

## Install

## Use

Log into mysql with the command "mysql -u `your username` -p" and enter your password when prompted. Next use the command "source db/schema.sql" to create our database. When that completes type "quit". Type the command "npm run seed" to seed the database with test data.
